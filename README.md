## mealMatch

####get food|give back

Meal match was created as a simple solution to the problem of restaurant food waste.

While the current version is a simple interactive prototype, the goal of the finished product would be to connect restaurants and users in a grubhub like experience. However when purchasing the user would pay an extra fee to have an additional meal delivered to a local foodbank or homeless shelter.

Feel free to fork / star / watch for your own personal use.
